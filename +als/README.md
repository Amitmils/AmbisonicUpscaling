# ALS
Code for the ALS (alternating least squares) algorithm for blind localization of early reflections.

The main interface is through `als.wrapper`.

See `examples.als` for a usage demo.

A reference is available [here](https://github.com/tomshlomo/als-amp-est/blob/main/ALS_ICASSP2021_preprint.pdf).

There is also [a separate repo](https://github.com/tomshlomo/als-amp-est) for this project.

The code is written for MATLAB 2020a and above. MATLAB 2019b should be fine as well.

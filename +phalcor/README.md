# PHALCOR
Code for the PHALCOR algorithm for blind localization of early reflections.

The main interface is through `phalcor.wrapper`.

See `examples.phalcor` for a usage demo.

An official reference is available [here](https://aranne5.bgu.ac.il/others/ShlomoTom19922.pdf).

The code is written for MATLAB 2020a and above. MATLAB 2019b should be fine as well.
